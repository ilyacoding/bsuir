Near the eastern shore of the Hudson, at the broad part of the Hudson river, there lies a small market-town which is called Greensburg, but which is more generally known by the name of Tarry Town. Not far from this town, perhaps about two miles, there is a little valley among high hills, which is one of the quietest places in the whole world. A small brook glides through it, with just murmur enough to lull one to rest, and the occasional whistle of a quail or tapping of a woodpecker is almost the only sound that ever breaks in the complete calmness.

And. Some people say that the place was bewitched by an old Indian chief during the early days of the settlement. Certain it is, the place still holds a spell over the minds of the good people, causing them to walk in a continual dreaminess. They are subject to trances and visions, and frequently see strange sights and hear music and voices in the air. The whole neighborhood abounds with local tales, haunted spots, and twilight superstitions; stars shoot and meteors glare more often across the valley than in any other part of the country, and the nightmare seems to make it the favorite place of her walks.
